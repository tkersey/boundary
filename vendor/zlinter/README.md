## Getting started

`zlinter` is not a standalone binary - it's built into your projects `build.zig`.
This makes it flexible to each projects needs. Simply add the dependency and
hook it up to a build step, like `zig build lint`:

**1. Save dependency to your zig project:**

   For 0.14.x:

   ```shell
   zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/kurtwagner/zlinter#0.14.x
   ```

   For 0.15.x:

   ```shell
   zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/kurtwagner/zlinter#0.15.x
   ```

   For master (0.16.x-dev):

   ```shell
   zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/kurtwagner/zlinter#master
   ```

**2. Configure `lint` step in your `build.zig`:**

  ```zig
   const zlinter = @import("zlinter");
   // ...
   const lint_cmd = b.step("lint", "Lint source code.");
   lint_cmd.dependOn(step: {
       // Swap in and out whatever rules you see fit from RULES.md
       var builder = zlinter.builder(b, .{});
       builder.addRule(.{ .builtin = .field_naming }, .{});
       builder.addRule(.{ .builtin = .declaration_naming }, .{});
       builder.addRule(.{ .builtin = .function_naming }, .{});
       builder.addRule(.{ .builtin = .file_naming }, .{});
       builder.addRule(.{ .builtin = .switch_case_ordering }, .{});
       builder.addRule(.{ .builtin = .no_unused }, .{});
       builder.addRule(.{ .builtin = .no_deprecated }, .{});
       builder.addRule(.{ .builtin = .no_orelse_unreachable }, .{});
       break :step builder.build();
   });
   ```

**3. Run linter:**

  Keep in mind the first run will be slower as the cache isn't warmed:

  ```shell
  zig build lint
  ```

  You can also be specific with paths (see [command-line arguments](#command-line-arguments) for more options):

  ```shell
  zig build lint -- --include src/ file.zig
  ```

### Alternative: Enable all built in rules

If you just want to test out zlinter, you can also enable all rules and then
selectively run rules from the command line. A lot of rules are quite pedantic
so this is not recommended outside of testing zlinters rules for your project:

1. Enable all built in rules in `build.zig`

  ```zig
  const zlinter = @import("zlinter");
  const lint_cmd = b.step("lint", "Lint source code.");
  lint_cmd.dependOn(step: {
      var builder = zlinter.builder(b, .{});
      inline for (@typeInfo(zlinter.BuiltinLintRule).@"enum".fields) |f| {
          builder.addRule(.{ .builtin = @enumFromInt(f.value) }, .{});
      }
      break :step builder.build();
  });
  ```

2. Selectively run rules:

  ```shell
  zig build lint -- --rule no_unused no_deprecated
  ```

## Autofix

Some linter rules support auto fixing some problems.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Auto fixing** is an **experimental feature** so only use it if you use source control - **always back up your code first!**

For example, to auto fix unused declarations and field ordering issues, assuming your project has these rules configured:

```shell
# First ensure you're working branch is clean (or back up your code!)
$ git status

# Then run the fix command (you may need to run this multiple times)
$ zig build lint -- --rule field_ordering --rule no_unused --fix
```

It can sometimes require a multiple runs to completely resolve all fixable issues. i.e., run with `--fix` until it reports 0 fixes applied.

## Custom rules

Bespoke rules can be added to your project. For example, maybe you really don't like cats, and refuse to let any `cats` exist in any identifier. See example rule [`no_cats`](./integration_tests/src/no_cats.zig), which is then integrated like builtin rules in your `build.zig`:

```zig
builder.addRule(b, .{
  .custom = .{
    .name = "no_cats",
    .path = "src/no_cats.zig",
  },
}, .{});
```

Alternatively, take a look at <https://github.com/KurtWagner/zlinter-custom-rule-example>, which is a minimal custom rule example with accompanying zig project.

## Configuration

### Configure paths

The builder used in `build.zig` has a method `addPaths`, which can be used to
add included and excluded paths. For example,

```zig
builder.addPaths(.{
    .include = &.{ b.path("engine-src/"), b.path("src/") },
    .exclude = &.{ b.path("src/android/"), b.path("engine-src/generated.zig") },
});
```

would lint zig files under `engine-src/` and `src/` except for `engine-src/generated.zig` and any zig files under `src/android/`.

### Configure Rules

`addRule` accepts an anonymous struct representing the `Config` of rule being added. For example,

```zig
builder.addRule(.{ .builtin = .field_naming }, .{
  .enum_field = .{ .style = .snake_case, .severity = .warning },
  .union_field = .off,
  .struct_field_that_is_type = .{ .style = .title_case, .severity = .@"error" },
  .struct_field_that_is_fn = .{ .style = .camel_case, .severity = .@"error" },
});
builder.addRule(.{ .builtin = .no_deprecated }, .{
  .severity = .warning,
});
```

where `Config` struct are found in the rule source files [`no_deprecated.Config`](./src/rules/no_deprecated.zig) and [`field_naming.Config`](./src/rules/field_naming.zig).

### Disable with comments

#### Disable next line

Disable all rules or an explicit set of rules for the next source code line.

Syntax:

```shell
zlinter-disable-next-line [rule_1] [rule_n] [- comment]`
```

For example,

```zig
// zlinter-disable-next-line no_deprecated - not updating so safe
const a = this.is.deprecated();
```

#### Disable current line

Disable all rules or an explicit set of rules for the current source code line.

Syntax:

```shell
zlinter-disable-current-line [rule_1] [rule_n] [- comment]
```

For example,

```zig
const a = this.is.deprecated(); // zlinter-disable-current-line
```

#### Disable multiple lines

Disable all rules or an explicit set of rules for multiple source code lines.

Syntax:

```shell
zlinter-disable [rule_1] [rule_n] [- comment]
zlinter-enable [rule_1] [rule_n] [- comment]
```

For example, to disable multiple lines for a given set of rules:

```zig
// zlinter-disable rule_a rule_b - rationale
var something = doSomethin();
var something_else = doSomethingElse();
// zlinter-disable rule_a rule_b
```

For example, to disable multiple lines for all rules:

```zig
// zlinter-disable - rationale
var something = doSomethin();
var something_else = doSomethingElse();
// zlinter-disable
```

If you omit `zlinter-enable`, all lines until EOF will be disabled.

### Command-Line Arguments

```shell
zig build lint -- [--include <path> ...] [--exclude <path> ...] [--filter <path> ...] [--rule <name> ...] [--fix] [--quiet] [--max-warnings <u32>]
```

- `--include` run the linter on these path ignoring the includes and excludes defined in the `build.zig` forcing these paths to be resolved and linted (if they exist).
- `--exclude` exclude these paths from linting. This argument will be used in conjunction with the excludes defined in the `build.zig` unless used with `--include`.
- `--filter` used to filter the run to a specific set of already resolved paths. Unlike `--include` this leaves the includes and excludes defined in the `build.zig` as is.
- `--quiet` only report errors (not warnings).
- `--max-warnings` fail if there are more than this number of warnings.
- `--fix` used to automatically fix some issues (e.g., removal of unused container declarations) - **Only use this feature if you use source control as it can result loss of code!**

For example

```shell
zig build lint -- --include src/ android/ --exclude src/generated.zig --rule no_deprecated no_unused
```

- Will resolve all zig files under `src/` and `android/` but will exclude linting `src/generated.zig`; and
- Only rules `no_deprecated` and `no_unused` will be ran.

### Configure Optimization

`zlinter.builder` accepts `.optimize` (defaults to `.Debug`). For example,

```zig
var builder = zlinter.builder(b, .{.optimize = .ReleaseFast });
```

If your project is large it may be worth setting optimize to `.ReleaseFast` - keep in mind the first run may be slower as it builds the the modules for the first time with the new optimisation.

## Supported zig versions

The plan is to support `master` (mostly because its an important exercise in keeping up to date with whats changing in zig) and the latest previous version.

Currently, [`0.14.x`](https://github.com/KurtWagner/zlinter/tree/0.14.x), [`0.15.x`](https://github.com/KurtWagner/zlinter/tree/0.15.x) and [`master`](https://github.com/KurtWagner/zlinter/tree/master).

Fixes and improvements to rules may be cherry-picked to older versions if there's no API compatibility issues.

This may change once zig hits `1.x`.

## Milestones

### Background

`zlinter` was written to be used across my personal projects. The main motivation was to have it integrated from source through a build step so that it can be

1. customized at build time (e.g., byo rules); and
2. versioned with your projects source control (no separate binary to juggle)

I'm opening it up incase it's more generally useful, and happy to let it
organically evolve around needs, if there's value in doing so.

It uses [`zls`](https://github.com/zigtools/zls) (an awesome project, go check it out if you haven't already) and `std.zig` to build and analyze zig source files.

### Current limitations

`zlinter` currently analyzes the Zig AST, which has limited context without trying to re-implement the Zig compiler (not doing).

See [limitations](./LIMITATIONS.md) for more information.

---

1. [done] **Rough implementaton of 20 diverse linter rules** - this is important to understanding limitations (e.g., the AST and design patterns to a stable API.)

1. [in-progress] **Run and review the results on at least 5 large open source Zig projects** - this is to discover unknown unknowns to populate caveats and limitations of current approach.

1. [pending] **To be informed by (1) and (2)** - could be that AST is good enough for enough cases to provide value providing adequate documentation, AND/OR, could be that it's worth contributing time into Zigs efforts around "multibuild" and zig compiler server.

## Versioning

`zlinter` will:

- follow the same semantic versioning as `zig`;
- use branch `master` for `zig` `master` releases; and
- use branch `0.14.x` for `zig` `0.14.x` releases.

This may change, especially when `zig` is "stable" at `1.x`. If you have opinions on this, feel free to comment on [#20](https://github.com/KurtWagner/zlinter/issues/20).

## Contributing

### Contributions

Contributions and new rules or formatters are very welcome.

Rules are per project configurable so I don't see any problems if new opinionated ones are added (assuming they're not completely bespoke).

If you notice breaking changes in `zig` that will not be picked up by a `Deprecated:` comment then consider contributing to the `no_deprecated.zig` rule, with a specific check for the change. For example, `zig` removed `usingnamespace` in `0.15` so `no_deprecated.zig` will explicitly check and report the usage of `usingnamespace` keyword in `0.14` runs.

### Dependencies

Zlinter avoids dependencies. It's just too much of a burden right now to depend
on something written for Zig when Zig isn't 1.x.

The one exception is ZLS, as it's well maintained and doesn't appear to be
going anywhere. More often than not I've wasted hours implementing a method to
find a very similar method already exists in ZLS, which makes sense, as ZLS
analyses Zig code using the AST like this linter currently does.

The AST Explorer provided with Zlinter will be similar and aims to be minimal.
Ideally no build system, no dependencies, just plain JS and CSS targetting
modern browers as the target audience should all have access to such things.

### Run tests

Unit tests:

```shell
zig build unit-test
```

Integration tests:

```shell
zig build integration-test
```

All tests:

```shell
zig build test
```

To focus on a single rule when running integration tests:

```shell
zig build integration-test -Dtest_focus_on_rule=require_braces
```

### Run lint on self

```shell
zig build lint
```

### Regenerate documentation

```shell
zig build docs
```

### Build and serve website (with AST explorer)

```shell
zig build website && npx http-server -c-1 zig-out/website
```

You don't need to use `npx`, its just static content in `zig-out/website`. You may decide to use `python -m http.server` instead.
