# Checked whole-program coalescing

Closed compilation and final linking always run P01. Typed/direct compilation,
standalone linking and Protean's compiled-tool path share the same mandatory
checked pipeline. There is no public off/safe selector. Open components defer
whole-program coalescing until closed linking.

P01 shares code and immutable descriptions. Effects, regions and resources keep
their nominal distinctions; entry and authority-sensitive functions stay pinned.
Function-local slot bijections and ordered captures/operands/edges are checked
independently of discovery. Runtime closures, cells, activations, handler
installations and resumptions keep their dynamic identities and custody.

Original admission and named-capture checks run before transformation. A separate
raw-record validator checks correspondence, and the candidate receives fresh
admission. Selection uses the exact encoded size with no growth; legal no-op and
deterministic work-limit rollback retain the original baseline. Observers and
diagnostics do not bypass those checks.

Structural compilation preserves its declared cross-build logical-step relation.
Additional semantic passes require the semantic contract and preserve specified
external behavior. Kronos always preserves the exact same-image stepping and
interruption contract. A changed image has a changed identity: old checkpoints and
reply envelopes cannot be transplanted. Ordinary codecs retain valid duplicate
records and do not silently optimize images.

Historical comparison runners use separately built predecessor executables through
`BOUNDARY_PREDECESSOR_BIN`; current emitters accept no mode. The 39 frozen Program
images from accepted `6313768` remain independent test inputs. No old compiler or
selector is embedded in the production library.
