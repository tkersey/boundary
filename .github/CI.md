# Qualification

Source syntax/formatting and the tracked Zig source inventory are checked before
compilation. The existing installation and contracts jobs remain independent:

```sh
zig build check-package -Doptimize=safe --summary all
zig build check -Doptimize=safe --summary all
```

The package check requires a clean committed candidate. One native driver
exports that commit, uses Zig to construct its package, then compiles the public
authoring and data-only APIs in a fresh consumer. Native category/owner/lifecycle
rejections and actual linker CLI behavior remain checked. There is no Node/Python
setup or source/package checker in the native path.

`check-native` is the interpreter-free subset. `check` additionally selects the
independent source oracle and wasm32 ABI byte/identity observations. The oracle
has only its exact-value helper and actual semantic cases; optional historical
experiments and their collectors are removed.

Compiler cache retention uses ordinary CI filesystem operations. Only a complete
regular-file/directory tree containing compiler objects and within four GiB is
saved. Over-budget or unsupported caches are left in place and not uploaded;
local data is never deleted to meet the upload bound. Package qualification owns
fresh caches; a cache hit never establishes source or execution qualification.

Rerun only the affected check after a change. Results apply to their actual
candidate and selected inputs; prior release qualification is not new-head proof.
